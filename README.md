### ```‚ö†Ô∏è Project is in Alpha phase so bugs and functionality limitations are there.```
#### ```I have worked hard to fix the ones I found but still feel free to raise any issues. All contributions are welcome.```

This project is a Reddit userbot built using the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW). The bot is designed to interact with Reddit by upvoting and replying to comments in a specific subreddit. It demonstrates basic usage of the PRAW library and serves as a starting point for building more advanced Reddit bots.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParthProLegend/reddit-userbot-praw-basic.git
   cd reddit-userbot-praw-basic
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages. Create and activate one with:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Create a `.ini` file in the root directory and add your Reddit API credentials:
   ```ini
   [account_reddit]
   client_id = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
   client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   username = YOUR_USERNAME
   password = YOUR_PASSWORD
   user_agent = YOUR_USER_AGENT
   subreddit = YOUR_SUBREDDIT
   number_of_submissions_to_check = NUMBER (default:20 if not provided)
   ```

   **Note**: The `.ini` file contains sensitive information (API keys, credentials) and is not tracked by Git (see `.gitignore`). Do not commit it to version control to avoid exposing your credentials.

   Note: For Setting Up the **[PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)** interface to obtain client_id and client_secret, check out **[OAuth2 Quick Start:First Steps](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps)**

4. (optional) Generate your own API key from **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)** and here's the Guide to generate API key on **[Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)**

5. Additional configuration in the `.ini` file is required for logging and Google GenAI integration.
   ```ini
   [logging]
   level = INFO
   file = app.log

   [google_api]
   google-genai = 1.44.0
   GEMINI_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
   system_instruction = YOUR_SYSTEM_INTRUCTIONS (like:"Always be friendly and polite.", etc.)
   response_base = RESPONSE_BASE {having 3 entries as "{comment_body}", "{submission_title}" and "{submission_selftext}"}
                  (like: 'Respond to \"{comment_body}\" which was a response to \"Title: {submission_title} and Content: {submission_selftext}\"'.)
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The bot will upvote and reply to comments in the specified subreddit.

3. (Pending Implementation) Configure the bot's behavior in the `.ini` file:
   ```ini
   [bot_settings]
   upvote_comments = True
   reply_to_comments = True
   clear_votes = True
   ```

4. To use Google GenAI (Gemini) for replies, set up the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the `.ini` file.

## Notes

- The bot clears upvotes after a short delay to comply with Reddit's rules.
- Ensure that your bot's actions comply with Reddit's API terms of service.
- For detailed output logs, check the `app.log` file or whatever is defined in your .ini.
- The logging configuration can be adjusted in the `main.py` and `.ini` file. By default, it logs to `app.log` with a log level of `INFO`.
- The `ColorCycler` class is used for cycling colors in terminal output. Ensure your terminal supports ANSI colors.

## Example .ini file

The bot need .ini file to run successfully, like this sample (with auto-replying enabled):

For Setting Up the **[PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)** interface to obtain client_id and client_secret, check out **[OAuth2 Quick Start:First Steps](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps)**

```ini
[account_reddit]
client_id = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
password = YOUR_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD
user_agent = PythonDesktop:PRAW:0.0.2 (by /u/RedditUsername for Testing Purposes)
username = YOUR_ACCOUNT_USERNAME
subreddit = SUBREDDIT_NAME_WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_RUN_THE_BOT
number_of_submissions_to_check = NUMBER_OF_SUBMISSIONS_TO_CHECK_IN_THE_SUB_USING_NEW_SORTING

[google_api]
google-genai = 1.44.0
GEMINI_API_KEY = YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
system_instruction = YOUR_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION (like: You are a human. Always be family friendly and polite, do not lie, do not respond professionally like a bot. You are not OP, and you does not refer to you.)
response_base = YOUR_RESPONSE_BASE (like: Give a short response to "{comment_body}" in response to a reddit with \"Title: {submission_title} and Content: {submission_selftext}\" in about 20 words.)

[logging]
enabled = True ; (Not Implemented Yet, planned)
level = INFO (Choose between DEBUG/INFO)
file = app.log (or any FILE_NAME.log)

[configuration]
USER_AGENT = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
PROXY = None
REQUEST_DELAY = 15
MAX_RETRIES = 10
ERROR_TIMEOUT = 60
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: `Invalid credentials` error.
  - **Solution**: Double-check your `.ini` file for correct Reddit API credentials.
- **Issue**: Bot does not upvote or reply.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the subreddit exists and has new posts.
- **Issue**: Rate limit errors.
  - **Solution**: Reduce the bot's activity or add delays between actions.
- **Issue**: Google GenAI integration problems.
  - **Solution**: Verify `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the `.ini` file and check your Google Cloud project settings.
- **Issue**: Colored terminal output not working.
  - **Solution**: Ensure your terminal supports ANSI colors. If using Windows, consider using Windows Terminal or enabling ANSI support in the command prompt.
