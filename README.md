PRAW, an acronym for "Python Reddit API Wrapper", is a Python package that allows for simple access to Reddit's API. PRAW aims to be easy to use and internally follows all of **[Reddit's API rules](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API)**. With PRAW there's no need to introduce `sleep` calls in your code. Give your client an appropriate user agent and you're set.

## Example Output

When the bot runs successfully, you might see output like this:

```
Successfully upvoted the comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/abc123/comment/xyz456
Successfully replied to the comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/abc123/comment/xyz456
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: `Invalid credentials` error.
  - **Solution**: Double-check your `.env` file for correct Reddit API credentials.
- **Issue**: Bot does not upvote or reply.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the subreddit exists and has new posts.
- **Issue**: Rate limit errors.
  - **Solution**: Reduce the bot's activity or add delays between actions.
